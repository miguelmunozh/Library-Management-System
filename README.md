# Library-Management-System

Library-Management-System is an application that simulates what you would see in a library if go to search for a book on their system.

This Graphical User Interface Library Management System application is written in java and MySql. Library Management System application 
utilizes a local database created with MySql command line. The local database was populated with a csv file available at 
'https://data.world/divyanshj/users-books-dataset/workspace/file?filename=BX-Books.csv' and with help of a third library party called 
`rs2xml.jar` a table was populated in the application with all the database information. Anyone can use the application to search for a book in the
database, but only administrators which log in into the system are able to add / remove users as normal or admin users, and add / remove books from 
the database through the application. Some Junit tests were written to test functions of the application.
